My personal portfolio website is a digital showcase of who I am and what I do.
It highlights my skills, projects, and journey as a frontend developer exploring the world of web technologies and design.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks, the website reflects my passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

It also includes:

🧑‍💻 An “About Me” section sharing my background and goals

💼 A “Projects” section featuring my best works

🧰 A “Skills” section listing tools and technologies I use

📬 A “Contact” form for collaboration or freelance inquiries

The goal of this website is to present my professional identity and demonstrate my ability to design and develop functional web experiences that blend creativity with logic.
